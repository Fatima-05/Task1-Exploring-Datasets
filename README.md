## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

### Task Objective
Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions using the Iris Dataset.

### Dataset Used
- **Iris Dataset**
- Loaded directly from URL using pandas
- 150 samples, 5 columns (4 numerical and 1 textual value)

### Models Applied
None

### Key Results and Findings
- Dataset is clean with no missing values and balanced classes.
- Strong visual separation between Setosa and the other two species.
- Petal length and petal width show clearer patterns than sepal measurements.
- Few outliers detected mainly in sepal.width.
- Visualizations (scatter plot, histograms, box plots) successfully demonstrate data distributions and relationships.
